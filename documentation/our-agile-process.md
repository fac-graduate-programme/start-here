## Copy of product owner's guide to our agile process

Agile is a way of working that aims to be transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

The roles particularly relevant to the agile process are; your role as product owner and the scrum master. Agile is aims to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity

The product owner and scrum master share responsibility for maximizing the value of the work of the development team. 

The product owner helps order item’s priority. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. This will predominantly be done in the 3rd workshop as well as an intro to GitHub. 

The Product Backlog is a map for the development team it will be on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

Backlog management includes:
- Each Backlog item has it's minimum requirements and stretch goals
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and shows what the Team will work on next


The development team is comprised four developers. Two from the London Founders and Coders cohort, Kate and Dylan. The remaining two are from [the Gaza Sky Geeks](https://gazaskygeeks.com/about-us/). The application process ongoing currently.

During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the product owner and development team as more is learned.

Sprints consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. The product owner is predominantly involved the sprint planning.
