## For a New Developer 


We are very team based and use the concept of **User Manuals**.
This is an idea taken from Founders & Coders...

As these projects involve going from strangers to working as a team in such a short period of time, this is attempt to make working together as successful and enjoable as possible.

These are located in the issues of this repo.
Each team member makes a issue, using the template.

The template is a series of questions, everyone is encouraged to update it as the project goes on. 

Read each others to faccilitate communication.
