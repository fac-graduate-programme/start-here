# Start-here
This is a collection of documentation, helpful for new developers and new projects

## For a New Developer 

We are very team based and use the concept of **User Manuals**.
This is an idea taken from Founders & Coders...

As these projects involve going from strangers to working as a team in such a short period of time, this is attempt to make working together as successful and enjoable as possible.

These are located in the issues of this repo.
Each team member makes a issue, using the template.

The template is a series of questions, everyone is encouraged to update it as the project goes on. 

Read each others to faccilitate communication.

### The GZG folder 
 For documentation written by the Gaza Sky Geeks developers

### The template folder covers common processes followed in each project. 
If the project repo you will be working on hasn't been created, this is where we will draw our documentation from.

### The workshop folder contains the workshops we do with the product owners

### The documetation folder contains documentation that is sent to the product owner
