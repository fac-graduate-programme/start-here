# Design Process Guide

Inital process will be started in the definition workshop with the client.

This can involve remote developers at that stage or ideas pre the workshop can be sent 


### We use the crazy eight process:

Take your paper and fold it into eight sections

Set the timer for eight minutes

Each team member sketches one idea in each rectangle

When the timer goes off, put your pens down

#### Sharing and Voting

Put up each sprinterâ€™s sketches together one at a time so everyone can see them clearly

Each person has three minutes to talk through the ideas they generated and answer any questions other teammates may have

Give each team member three votes

The team will have five minutes to indicate the three most compelling ideas by voting on the specific sketches (not the entire paper)

It is ok to vote for your own sketch or to put all three dots on one idea if you think it is truly the most valuable to pursue


## Prototyping

From the ideas generated we create initial prototype screens in figma in black, white and grey

Initally we do individual screen and the come together to colaberate and make a style for the app that is uniform

## Design System

We generate a design style, including different fonts, spacing and color
