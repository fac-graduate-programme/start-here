# Workshop 3


## Build Sprint Planning 

This workshop is to form a map for the build sprints from the prototype and the user feedback.

## Review User Feedback & Prototype

### Heatmap Voting

As a precursor to a Dot Vote, Heatmap Voting is a Design Sprint method to zero in on features or ideas the team considers impactful. In this method, team members get an unlimited amount of smaller dots and can use as many dots as they want to vote on specific features in all the Solution Sketches, versus voting for an entire sketch. This should be done rather quickly — take no more than five minutes for it. The intention is to create a heatmap on the sketches that shows which features the team as a whole thinks are worth prototyping. This is generally followed by a discussion of the features and then a round of prioritization voting.

Use smaller dots (smaller than those used in the Dot Vote)
Team members can use as many dots as they need to vote for specific sketch features.
Remind the team that they’re not voting for an entire Solution Sketch, but for features within the sketches
As ever, prior to voting, review the business problem, the goals, and success metrics so everyone knows what the voting criteria are. Be sure to remind them that this is a deciding vote”


## Our agile process

Agile is a way of working that aims to be transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

The roles particularly relevant to the agile process are; the product owner and the scrum master. Agile is aims to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity

The product owner and scrum master share responsibility for maximizing the value of the work of the development team. 

The product owner helps order item’s priority. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. 



The Product Backlog is a map for the development team it will be on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Backlog management includes:
- Each Backlog item has it's minimum requirements and stretch goals
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and shows what the Team will work on next


## Decision Matrix

A Decision Matrix is a Design Sprint method that helps a team evaluate ideas based on a set of specific criteria most useful to the goals of the Sprint. This is a useful method to deploy when the team is unable to reach a clear consensus with a Dot Vote. The matrix is a simple table or diagram and most commonly compares user impact versus implementation effort. Ideally, you want ideas that are either high impact/low effort or high impact/high effort.

Select the most useful criteria for evaluating your ideas
For example, if you are looking at impact for effort, Label the Y axis (left) as “Impact” with “High Impact” at the top of the axis and “Low Impact” at the bottom
Label the X axis (bottom) as “Effort” with “Low Effort” on the left and “High Effort” on the right
As a group, plot all your ideas along these two axes, discussing which ideas fall into the high impact/low effort and high impact/high effort ranges
Once your matrix is mapped, remove any low impact ideas (whether low or high effort) and vote again. You can always capture the ideas in a document for a later date
