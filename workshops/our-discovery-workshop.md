# Workshop 1

This workshop is to figure out the scope of the problem is trying to address.

## Braindump Exercise:

getting everything down, it doesn't need to be structured yet. 

## Lets put into some structure
what do we want to achieve by solving this problem?

Start with the why: 

Stakeholders:
your solution is for whom?

Product/ process audit 
who is already achieving this
Competition
who has vested interests?

technical limitations
Metrics?

value 

propositions 


Inspration design, methods. 
 
 ## Create a user persona
- This is for the 20% who will use it 80% of the time
- perspective users
- once offs
- people who know of your product but don't use it

*The reason why we do this is
 **Goals + Frustrations = Needs**
We are trying to identify your product user, organize them into a a generalisation,  figure out how we can engage them and plan the actions we need to take to get the behaviours we want [aka to use our app and benefit from it]*


Demographics:
- age
- status
- location 

Tech they use:

Their motivations [not specificly for using your app] 
- intrinsic/ extrinsc

Who or what influences them:

Action you want them to do:

Behaviours [the engagement you want]

Their point of view of your product [and the one you want]


## Going a tad deeper..

**Empathy maps**

It's all about them and how they are pre your product and how the experience the problem we are trying to solve.
