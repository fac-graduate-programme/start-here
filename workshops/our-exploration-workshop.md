# Workshop 2

This workshop is to refine the problem and generate potential for solutions.

**First Recap**
Your user’s goals:

Their motivations:

Their current pain points:

Their overall character:

The main tasks they want to achieve:


## Summary

When [status] I want to [motivation] so I can [outcome]


## How might we...

The “How Might We” (HMW) method, we use it to capture opportunities and ideas.This is an exercise in expansive thinking aimed at preventing the team from arriving at premature solutions.  

We are looking for opportunities rather than solutions. Each word of the HMW phrase puts team members in the right mindset:

**“How”** guides team members to believe the answer is out there.

**“Might”** lets team members know their HMW statement might or might not work, and either possibility is okay

**“We”** reminds us this is about teamwork and building on each others’ ideas

Do not spend a lot of time crafting or perfecting HMW statements. Instead come up with as many HMW notes as we can, with as little self-editing as possible. 

 Turn challenges into opportunities for design.A properly framed How Might We doesn’t suggest a particular solution, but gives you the perfect frame for innovative thinking.


**Affinity Mapping** 
is used to categorize HMW sticky notes into themes. This is a way to share the opportunities.

Think broadly and explore as many angles as possible. It may take a little while for solid affinity categories to form.

Don’t forget a miscellaneous category; some things just don’t fit, and these opportunities are important to consider along with all others.

## User stories

What is a user journey?
A user journey is a series of steps (typically 4-12) which represent a scenario in which a user might interact with the thing you are designing. 

 - User journeys can help you work out how users are going to interact with your system and what they expect from it.
- By understanding the key tasks they will want to do to we can start to understand what sort of functional requirements will help enable those tasks 
- By understanding this we can think about what sort of structure can help support those tasks and what kind of interface the user will be needing to accomplish them.
- Demonstrating the vision for the project 

*Start the user journey with the user’s initial entry point. 
Add each step in the journey until the user’s goal has been reached
Include descriptions for each step and highlight pain points along the journey*


You can think broadly in each step about things such as:

**Context** – Where is the user? What is around them? Are there any external factors which may be distracting them? 

**Progression** – How does each step enable them to get to the next?

**Devices** – what device are they using? Are they a novice or expert? What features does the device have?

**Functionality** – What type of functionality are they expecting? Is it achievable?

**Emotion** – What is their emotional state in each step? Are they engaged, bored, annoyed? Read more about mapping emotion to user journeys

**Put on some structure**
A picture of the persona the journey relates to
A title summarising the journey e.g “Faster uploading with new CMS”
A series of steps in short, concise text
An illustration of what’s happening in the step (if deemed necessary)
And then per step:

### We use the crazy eight process:

Take your paper and fold it into eight sections

Set the timer for eight minutes

Each team member sketches one idea in each rectangle

When the timer goes off, put your pens down

#### Sharing and Voting
![](https://i.imgur.com/u5B0YPe.png)

As a precursor to a Dot Vote, Heatmap Voting is a Design Sprint method to zero in on features or ideas the team considers impactful. 

The intention is to create a heatmap on the sketches that shows which features the team as a whole thinks are worth prototyping. This is generally followed by a discussion of the features and then a round of prioritization voting.

Remind the team that they’re not voting for an entire Solution Sketch, but for features within the sketches

Put up each sprinter’s sketches together one at a time so everyone can see them clearly

Each person has three minutes to talk through the ideas they generated and answer any questions other teammates may have

Give each team member three votes

The team will have five minutes to indicate the three most compelling ideas by voting on the specific sketches (not the entire paper)

It is ok to vote for your own sketch or to put all three dots on one idea if you think it is truly the most valuable to pursue
